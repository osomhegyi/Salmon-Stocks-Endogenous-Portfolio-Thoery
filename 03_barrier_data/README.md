- `barriers_list` - list that contains all 19 population barrier datasets 

#### Workflow
1. Run code lines 4 - 158. Each of these data frames are population specific barrier data generated from the GIS modelbuilder. Each dataframe contains ranked barriers based on the location and passability of each barrier. 
2. Run code lines 161 - 197. This results in a list with each populationâ€™s barrier data called `barriers_list`. This needs to be a list moving forward to allow for each iteration of our model to keep all populations together in one portfolio. 

#### Moving Forward
- If the user has obtained additional or updated barrier information, that data can be applied in this script before generating the `barriers_list` object.
