### Summary
 
 
#### Variables
- `coho_recruits` -  adult coho spawner abundance with coefficients 'recuits_flip' and 'abundance_flip' needed for nls analysis
- `calculate_equil_abundance` - function to calculate equilibrium abundance 
- `all_nls` - function to perform nonlinear least squares to find baseline productivity and carrying capacity coefficients 
- `equilibrium_all` - dataframe that holds the output of all_nls function using coho_recuits data


#### Workflow
- This section will be the workflow of the script


#### Moving Forward
- This section will be areas where things can be modified moving forward with the analysis
