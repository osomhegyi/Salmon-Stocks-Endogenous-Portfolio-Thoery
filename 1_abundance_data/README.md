### Summary
- This README summarizes the 1_abundance_data.R script. The user will run all lines of code to read in the Oregon Coast coho salmon abundance data.

#### Variables
- `coho`: data frame that holds return adult coho spawner abundance data for each population

#### Workflow
- 1. Run all libraries. These libraries will be needed for functions used across all scripts in this project
- 2. Run code lines 18 - 22 to read in the ODFW data 


#### Moving Forward
- If the user would like to apply this framework to another species, life history data would be needed moving forward. This script would be where to include new species data that contain abundance over time.
